        <div class="workshop-subsection">Overview</div>
        <p>Virtual Reality technologies are growing fast, and so is the VR research community. In this scenario, it is more important than ever that academic research builds upon best practices and results to amplify impact in the broader field. Open-Source tools are one means to propagate best practice as they lower the barrier to entry for researchers from an engineering point of view, while also embodying the prior work on which the tools were built. Open access tools are also critical to eliminate redundancies and increase world research collaboration in VR. At a time that academic research is growing it also needs to move as fast as the industry, collaboration and shared tools is the best way to do it.</p>

         <div class="workshop-subsection">Description</div>
         <p>Driven by uptake in consumer and professional markets, virtual reality technologies are now being developed at a significant pace. Academic research needs to build upon best practice and results if it is to generate generalizable results that have impact in the broader field. Open-Source tools are one means to propagate best practice as they lower the barrier to entry for researchers from an engineering point of view, while also embodying the prior work on which the tools were built. Open access tools are also critical to eliminate redundancies and increase world research collaboration in VR. At a time that academic research needs to move as fast as the industry, collaboration and shared tools is the best way to do it.   </p>

		<p> 
		 In this workshop, we will gather with creators and users of open-access libraries ranging  from avatars (like the Microsoft Rocketbox avatar library) to animation to networking  (Ubiq toolkit) to explore how open access tools are helping advance the VR community.  </p>

		<p>We invite all researchers to join this workshop and learn from existing libraries. We also invite submissions on technical and systems papers that describe new libraries and or new features on existing libraries. </p>


		<p>In this workshop, we will explore these open-access tools, their accessibility, and what type of applications they enable. Finally, we invite users of current libraries to submit their papers and share their learnings while using these tools. </p>


		<p>All papers and repos will be collected and curated in the workshop website  <a href="https://openVRlab.github.io/">https://openVRlab.GitHub.io</a>.</p>
