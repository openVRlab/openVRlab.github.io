        <div class="workshop-subsection">Open Access Tools and libraries for virtual reality (OAT) Workshop Overview</div>
        <p>Virtual reality researchers and developers need tools to develop state of the art technologies that will help advance knowledge. Promoting open-Source tools which can be modified or redistributed will be of great help for doing this. Open-Source tools are one means to propagate best practice as they lower the barrier to entry for researchers from an engineering point of view, while also embodying the prior work on which the tools were built. Open access tools are also critical to eliminate redundancies and increase world research collaboration in VR. At a time that academic research is growing it also needs to move as fast as industry, collaboration and shared tools are the best way to do it. In this scenario, it is more important than ever that academic research builds upon best practices and results to amplify impact in the broader field. 
		</p>

         <div class="workshop-subsection">Description</div>
         <p>
		Driven by uptake in consumer and professional markets, virtual reality technologies are now being developed at a significant pace. Open access tools are also critical to eliminate redundancies and increase world research collaboration in VR. At a time that academic research needs to move as fast as the industry, collaboration and shared tools are the best way to do it.  
		We will gather creators and users of open-access libraries ranging from avatars (like the Microsoft Rocketbox avatar library) to animation to networking (Ubiq toolkit) to explore how open access tools are helping advance the VR community.  We invite all researchers to join the second edition of this workshop and learn from existing libraries. We also invite submissions on technical and systems papers that describe new libraries and or new features of existing libraries. In this workshop, we will explore these open-access tools, their accessibility, and what type of applications they enable.

		We invite all researchers to join the second edition of this workshop and learn from existing libraries. We also invite submissions on technical and systems papers that describe new libraries and or new features on existing libraries. In this workshop, we will explore these open-access tools, their accessibility, and what type of applications they enable. Finally, we invite users of current libraries to submit their papers and share their learnings while using these tools. All papers and repos will be collected and curated in the workshop website <a href="">  https://openaccess.github.io/

         <div class="workshop-subsection">Format and submission guidelines</div>
         <p>Submissions should include a title, a list of authors, and be 2-4 pages. All paper submissions must be in English. All IEEE VR Conference Paper submissions must be prepared in IEEE Computer Society VGTC format (<a href="https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/"> https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/</a>) and submitted in PDF format. 
           Accepting work of Research papers, Technical notes, Position papers, Work-in-progress papers.&nbsp;</p>
         <p>The accepted papers will be featured in the IEEE Xplore library. Additional pages can be considered on a case by case basis, but you should check with the workshop organizers (<a href="mailto:m.volonte@northeastern.edu">m.volonte@northeastern.edu.</a>) before the submission deadline. Acceptable paper types are work-in-progress, research papers, position papers, or commentaries. Submissions will be reviewed by the organisers and accepted submissions will give a 10-minute talk with a panel discussion at the end of the session. At least one author must register for the workshop. Selected submissions will get the opportunity to be extended to articles to be considered for a special issue.</p>
		<p>To submit your work, visit <a href="https://new.precisionconference.com/vr">https://new.precisionconference.com/vr</a></p>
		The organizers will review all the submissions.

                 <p>Dr. Matias Volonte is currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Department of Computer Science at Northeastern University. He is working with Dr. Tim Bickmore from the Relational Agents Group.
           Currently, Matias is investigating the use of virtual agents in which human-agent relationships improve task outcomes in the healthcare domain. Matias is interested in researching simulated face-to-face conversations with an emphasis on the relational and conversational aspects of these interactions. In his Ph.D. at Clemson University, Matias studied human and virtual human interaction in immersive and non-immersive environments with Dr. Sabarish Babu.
