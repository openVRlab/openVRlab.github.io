        <div class="workshop-subsection">Open Access Tools and libraries for virtual reality (OAT) Workshop Overview</div>
        <p>Virtual reality researchers and developers need tools to develop state of the art technologies that will help advance knowledge. Promoting open-Source tools which can be modified or redistributed will be of great help for doing this. Open-Source tools are one means to propagate best practice as they lower the barrier to entry for researchers from an engineering point of view, while also embodying the prior work on which the tools were built. Open access tools are also critical to eliminate redundancies and increase world research collaboration in VR. At a time that academic research is growing it also needs to move as fast as industry, collaboration and shared tools are the best way to do it. In this scenario, it is more important than ever that academic research builds upon best practices and results to amplify impact in the broader field. 
		</p>

         <div class="workshop-subsection">Description</div>
         <p>
		Driven by uptake in consumer and professional markets, virtual reality technologies are now being developed at a significant pace. Open access tools are also critical to eliminate redundancies and increase world research collaboration in VR. At a time that academic research needs to move as fast as the industry, collaboration and shared tools are the best way to do it.  
		We will gather creators and users of open-access libraries ranging from avatars (like the Microsoft Rocketbox avatar library) to animation to networking (Ubiq toolkit) to explore how open access tools are helping advance the VR community.  We invite all researchers to join the second edition of this workshop and learn from existing libraries. We also invite submissions on technical and systems papers that describe new libraries and or new features of existing libraries. In this workshop, we will explore these open-access tools, their accessibility, and what type of applications they enable.

		We invite all researchers to join the second edition of this workshop and learn from existing libraries. We also invite submissions on technical and systems papers that describe new libraries and or new features on existing libraries. In this workshop, we will explore these open-access tools, their accessibility, and what type of applications they enable. Finally, we invite users of current libraries to submit their papers and share their learnings while using these tools. All papers and repos will be collected and curated in the workshop website <a href="">  https://openaccess.github.io/
